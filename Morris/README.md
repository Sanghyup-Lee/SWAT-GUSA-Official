# Morris
Morris method application in our main SWAT-GUSA project.

# Objective
- SWAT-GUSA has a change of landuse and tree canopy cover data.
- A numerous parameters influence to change hydrological results via landuse and canopycover changes.
- Limitation of computational cost to analysis uncertainty as considered all parameters.
- We decided to use Morris method at first to screen the most influential parameters from our model.
